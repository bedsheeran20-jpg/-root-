                   The day just felt off from the start. Nothing big seemed wrong, but there were all these tasks stacking up. That little mistake from yesterday still needed sorting out, and everything was moving so slow.

It would have been simple to push through too fast or just put it off till tomorrow. I think thats what a lot of people might do.

But anyway, I got one small thing done first. Then moved to the next one.

Later in the afternoon, something went wrong, broke maybe. Frustration started building up. There was this point where stopping altogether made sense, like why bother.

After taking a break though, I kept going. It wasnt perfect, kind of careful but messy in spots.

Not all the work got finished by the end. Enough did, I guess. The mistake was taken care of at least. Things kept moving ahead.

Perseverance isnt some big dramatic thing. It just means sticking with it when quitting feels easier. That part stands out to me.
